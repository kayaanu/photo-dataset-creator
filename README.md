# photo-dataset-creator

Program that takes photos in quick succession, for uni assignment.

`renamer.py` exists because `rapid_photo.py` takes photos in batches of 50. This was done so I could take 50 images of each throw (rock, paper, scissors), for each hand (left, right), resulting in a dataset of 100 iamges per throw.
